# Prioritization---Emergiencies
I have used deep learning to create two classification algorithms, one for the detection of brain bleeds on head CT images, and one for the detection of aortic dissection on chest x-ray images. Now, we need to figure out how to integrate these algorithms into the radiologist's workflow so that they are most helpful clinically.  We have the following:-  A list of images that have come in through the ED in order of patient arrival. Probabilities of 'brain bleed' for each image, as determined by one of our deep learning algorithms. Probabilities of 'aortic dissection' for each image, as determined by one of our deep learning algorithms.
